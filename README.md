Axis is an **agent secrets vault (ASV)** — a local, MCP-native broker that lets AI agents call external services without ever receiving raw credentials.

---

## How It Works

```
Agent (Cursor / Claude Code)
  │
  │  request_credential({ service: "openai", action: "responses.create", params: {...} })
  ▼
Axis MCP Server  ──── policy check ──── audit log
  │
  │  injects stored API key
  ▼
OpenAI API  ──── raw response ────► back to agent

(API key is NEVER returned to the agent)
```

Axis is an agent secrets vault. The agent describes what it needs; Axis checks policy, proxies the call with the stored credential, and returns only the API response — the key never leaves the Axis process.

If Axis is useful to you, [starring the repo](https://github.com/cooperdunkin/axis-asv) helps others find it.

## 5-Minute Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- npm

### 1. Install globally

```bash
npm install -g axis-asv
```

### 2. Initialise Axis

```bash
axis init
```

This creates:
- `~/.axis/`  — encrypted keystore and audit log (restricted to mode 700)
- `config/policy.yaml` — allow/deny rules
- `data/` — runtime data directory

### 3. Store your OpenAI API key

```bash
axis add openai
```

You will be prompted for:
1. Your **master password** (used to encrypt the key at rest — choose a strong one)
2. Your **OpenAI API key** (`sk-...`)

Neither value is echoed to the terminal.

### 4. Configure your MCP host

#### Cursor

Add to `~/.cursor/mcp.json` (or your project's `.cursor/mcp.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "axis": {
      "command": "axis",
      "args": ["mcp"],
      "env": {
        "AXIS_IDENTITY": "local-dev",
        "AXIS_MASTER_PASSWORD": "your-master-password-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Claude Code

Add to `~/.claude.json` (global) or `.mcp.json` (project-level):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "axis": {
      "command": "axis",
      "args": ["mcp"],
      "env": {
        "AXIS_IDENTITY": "local-dev",
        "AXIS_MASTER_PASSWORD": "your-master-password-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> **Security note:** `AXIS_MASTER_PASSWORD` in the MCP config file is stored in **plaintext on disk**. Use `axis keychain set` to store it in your OS keychain instead — see [Keychain Setup](#keychain-setup-recommended) below.

### 5. Verify everything works

```bash
axis doctor
```

---

## Keychain Setup (Recommended)

By default, `AXIS_MASTER_PASSWORD` must be set in your MCP config file — stored in plaintext on disk. To eliminate this risk, store the master password in your OS keychain instead:

```bash
axis keychain set
```

Then update your MCP config to remove `AXIS_MASTER_PASSWORD`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "axis": {
      "command": "axis",
      "args": ["mcp"],
      "env": {
        "AXIS_IDENTITY": "local-dev"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Axis will retrieve the master password from your OS keychain automatically on startup.

**Linux users:** Install libsecret before running keychain commands:

```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install libsecret-1-dev
# Fedora
sudo dnf install libsecret-devel
```

## MCP Tool Reference

Axis exposes **one tool**: `request_credential`

### Input

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `service` | string | ✓ | Service to call (e.g. `"openai"`) |
| `action` | string | ✓ | Action to perform (e.g. `"responses.create"`) |
| `justification` | string | ✓ | Why this call is being made (audit-logged) |
| `params` | object | ✓ | Service-specific request parameters |

### Output (allowed)

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "result": { /* API response */ },
  "request_id": "uuid-v4"
}
```

### Output (denied)

```json
{
  "denied": true,
  "reason": "Policy denied: identity=\"local-dev\" service=\"openai\" action=\"...\"|",
  "request_id": "uuid-v4"
}
```

### Example agent usage

```
Use the request_credential tool to ask Axis to generate a response:

{
  "service": "openai",
  "action": "responses.create",
  "justification": "Summarising the uploaded document for the user",
  "params": {
    "model": "gpt-4o",
    "input": "Summarise the following text in 3 sentences: ..."
  }
}
```

---

## Policy Configuration

Edit `config/policy.yaml` to control which identities can call which services.

**Deny-by-default**: a request is rejected unless an explicit `allow` rule matches.

```yaml
policies:
  - identity: local-dev        # matches AXIS_IDENTITY env var
    allow:
      - service: openai
        actions:
          - responses.create   # only this action is permitted

  # Wildcards
  - identity: "*"              # any identity
    allow:
      - service: public-svc
        actions:
          - "*"                # any action
```

### Identity resolution

The identity used for policy checks comes from the `AXIS_IDENTITY` environment variable set in your MCP host config. Fallback: `"unknown"`.

---

## Encryption Details

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Algorithm | AES-256-GCM |
| Key derivation | PBKDF2-SHA-512, 210,000 iterations |
| Salt | 32 bytes, unique per entry |
| Nonce/IV | 12 bytes, unique per entry |
| Auth tag | 128 bits |
| Storage | `~/.axis/keystore.json`, mode 600 |

Each stored secret gets its own randomly generated salt and IV. The master password is never stored — only derived keys are used per-operation.

---

## Audit Log

All requests are logged to `~/.axis/audit.jsonl`. Each line is a JSON object:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-01-15T10:30:00.000Z",
  "request_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "identity": "local-dev",
  "service": "openai",
  "action": "responses.create",
  "decision": "allow",
  "justification": "Summarising document for user",
  "latency_ms": 342,
  "error": null
}
```

**Secrets are never logged.** The audit log contains only metadata.

---

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Context | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `AXIS_MASTER_PASSWORD` | MCP server, `axis mcp` | Master password to unlock keystore. Optional if stored in OS keychain via `axis keychain set`; env var takes priority when set. |
| `AXIS_IDENTITY` | MCP server | Identity for policy checks (default: `"unknown"`) |
| `AXIS_POLICY_PATH` | MCP server | Override path to policy.yaml |

---

## Development

```bash
npm run build          # compile TypeScript → dist/
npm run build:watch    # watch mode
npm test               # run test suite (uses tsx, no build needed)
npm run test:built     # run tests against compiled output
npm run lint           # type-check without emitting
```

### Adding a new service

1. Create `src/proxy/<service>.ts` implementing `proxyRequest(params, keystore)`.
2. Register it in the dispatch table in `src/proxy/openai.ts` (`proxyRequest` function).
3. Add allow rules for the new service in `config/policy.yaml`.
4. Run `axis add <service>` to store the credential.

## Threat Model Notes

### What Axis protects against

| Threat | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| **Agent receives raw credential** | Credentials never appear in tool responses; the proxy injects them server-side |
| **Credential leaked in logs** | Audit log records only metadata; request bodies with potential secrets are never logged |
| **Credential stored in plaintext** | AES-256-GCM encryption at rest; unique salt+IV per entry prevents rainbow tables |
| **Unauthorised service access** | Deny-by-default YAML policy; identity-scoped allow rules |
| **Credential used for unintended action** | Policy rules are scoped to specific `service` + `action` pairs |
| **Secrets in source control** | `~/.axis/` is outside the repo; `data/` and `.env` files are `.gitignore`d |
| **Tampered keystore entry** | AES-GCM authentication tag detects any modification to ciphertext |

### What Axis does NOT protect against

| Threat | Notes |
|---|---|
| **Compromised local machine** | An attacker with OS-level access can read `~/.axis/keystore.json` and, if they have the master password, decrypt all secrets. Full disk encryption (FileVault, LUKS) is the appropriate defence. |
| **Malicious MCP host process** | The MCP host (Cursor, Claude Code) receives the full API response from Axis. A malicious or compromised host process could intercept this. Axis assumes the MCP host is trusted. |
| **`AXIS_MASTER_PASSWORD` in MCP config** | Mitigated by `axis keychain set`, which stores the master password in your OS keychain (macOS Keychain, Linux Secret Service, Windows Credential Manager) so it never appears in config files. See [Keychain Setup](#keychain-setup-recommended). If you use the env var approach instead, restrict config file permissions with `chmod 600`. |
| **Memory scraping** | Decrypted secrets pass through process memory. An attacker with memory-read access (e.g. via ptrace) could extract them. |
| **Policy misconfiguration** | Overly broad wildcards (`"*"`) in policy.yaml grant wide access. Review policy rules carefully. |
| **Denial of service** | Axis supports per-identity rate limiting (configurable via `rateLimit.requestsPerMinute` in policy.yaml), but it is off by default and only limits request volume — not API quota consumption per request. A compromised agent could still exhaust API quota with large or expensive requests. |
| **Supply chain attacks** | Axis depends on `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`, `js-yaml`, and `uuid`. Review their integrity in production deployments. |

### Recommended additional hardening

- Enable full-disk encryption on the host machine.
- Set restrictive permissions on your MCP config file: `chmod 600 ~/.cursor/mcp.json`
- Rotate the master password periodically (requires re-encrypting all entries).
- Review `~/.axis/audit.jsonl` regularly for unexpected requests.
- Use `axis keychain set` to store the master password in your OS keychain, eliminating the need for `AXIS_MASTER_PASSWORD` in plaintext MCP config files.
